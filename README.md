# [Frontend] React -- Landing page for Mooch
The idea behind this project is to prototype a new landing page for Mooch with React framework. It's a Single Page Application, where user can scroll all related content in a page. To increase readability, I also implement switchable bookmark and automatic carousel/slider component.
